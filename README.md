Depths of the Forsaken
======================

This will be cool one day. (Probably not)

A game written with no design process and maximal tech debt.

## License

This game probably needs a license. Maybe one day.
But the font the game uses is under the Apache License. The license is located in the fonts/ directory.

## The Game

The game should just work? Right? The crappy text version can be run by invoking `./depths.py`.
The non-functional graphical version can be run by invoking `./foo.py`. It doesn't do anything.
To learn more about how the game works, read the Manual.md. Which is probably out of date.
